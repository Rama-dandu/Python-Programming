print("hello"+"world") #hello world with no space
#if we want to print we can do it in 3 ways
#1 providing space after hello
print("hello "+"world")
#2 providing space before world
print("hello"+" world")
#3 providing space as a string between hello and world
print("hello"+" "+"world")

#we should provide space before starting the line
print("indentation error\n") #if we provide space it will give indentation error: unexpected indent
